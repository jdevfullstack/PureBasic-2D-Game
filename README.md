I'm happy to share with you my simple 2D game purely written in
PureBasic.

When you create games, whether 2D or 3D, there is no such thing
as *real movement*. Rather, when you flip the frames and you
had changed the position of an object relative to its original position,
you create the illusion of movement! That's all there is in creating
computer games! Of course, complex movements will require math computation.

Remember the screen resolution: 1024x768. This is the most common one.
When there is an error, don't worry, it will be handled by the 
`HandleError` in the source code.
